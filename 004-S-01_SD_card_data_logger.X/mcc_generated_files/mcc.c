  @Summary:
    This is the mcc.c file generated using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description:
    This header file provides implementations for driver APIs for all modules selected in the GUI.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.95-b-SNAPSHOT
        Device            :  dsPIC33EP128GS804
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.36
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v5.10
